# Vaccine Management System - Frontend code in REACT.js
This React code is part of the Vaccine Management System project. 
We built a 3-tier architecture with front-end in REACT.js, back-end in Django (Python) and Mysql database.

## Step Followed:
1. We first build an ERD diagram based on the requriment document
2. Using ERD we design the relations and create models in Django (uses object -relation mapper)
3. We then build Django Views (backend logic) and connect it with the frontend REACT via API REST calls.
